Team - Safe one

The project's main objective is to create a system which will enable the FDA official to track and locate contaminated sources and prevent further outbreaks. The data from the entities in the supply chain will be verified by FDA and provided to the system, which will in turn clean and visualize. The main component of the system will be on the Network graph, allowing the FDA official to see the whole supply chain process to trackback. Trackback makes every component of that item to its source to prevent additional contamination and outbreak. This system will also attempt to enhance the precision of the contaminating source's location and shorten the time it takes to locate it.
